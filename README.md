# BlockDive-MCP - Multi-Chain Blockchain Explorer

## About Nodit MCP Integration

BlockDive-MCP is built on top of Nodit's Model Context Protocol (MCP), a powerful system that enables seamless integration between AI systems and blockchain data. MCP allows our application to:

- Directly access and interact with Nodit's RPC Nodes, Node APIs, Web3 Data APIs, and Aptos Indexer APIs
- Retrieve real-time blockchain data without complex infrastructure setup
- Process and analyze on-chain data efficiently through AI-friendly interfaces
- Maintain lightweight context while maximizing token efficiency
